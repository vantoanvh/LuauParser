A modern, fully featured **[Lua*u*](https://luau.org/)** parser written entirely in Luau<br>
Fully strict-typing with the New Type Solver and optimized for high performance.

## Introduction
> Only compatibles with <strong>New Type Solver</strong>.

A complete port of **[Parser.cpp](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/blob/master/Ast/src/Parser.cpp)** providing both *AST* **(Abstract Syntax Tree)** & *CST* **(Concrete Syntax Tree)**.<br>
**To stay true to the original implementation**, the CST does not include low-level trivia such as whitespace.

This Lua*u* parser is primarily intended for plugin development and for building Lua*u* compilers or tooling.<br>
It provides detailed syntax through both **AST** and **CST**, making it well suited for advanced language tooling such as *linters, formatters, highlighter, refactoring tools,* or even a full *luau compiler/transpiler.*

## Performance

> After `0.710` updates, I do alot of optimization changes, and able to make this **FASTER** than **[luaup](https://github.com/jackdotink/luaup)** itself.

This parser is fast because it uses a simple singleton-style procedural design. It just resets its internal variables and runs, avoiding the overhead of more complex architectures.

## Code Examples
```luau
local Parser = require(path.to.LuauParser)

local success, result = Parser.parse('local foo: (string, ...number) -> (...any)')

if success then
	print(result.root) -- do anything you want
else
	warn(result.errors)
end
```
